Meme Analyzer is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to upload a meme image and a chat file. The application analyzes the meme using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to extract text and **Google GenAI** to generate a detailed explanation of the meme, including its type, sentiment, and a humorous explanation.
